# This project implements a Neural Style Transfer (NST) system that applies the artistic style of one image to the content of another image using deep learning techniques. The system allows users to upload a content image and a style image, then generates a new image that preserves the content structure while adopting the artistic patterns of the style image.A pre-trained Neural Style Transfer model from TensorFlow Hub is used to efficiently perform style transfer without training a model from scratch. To address file caching and overwrite issues in Google Colab, the implementation dynamically selects uploaded filenames and reloads images on every execution, ensuring that different inputs always produce different outputs.

# Tools used 

# Python – Programming language used for implementation

# TensorFlow – Deep learning framework for image processing

# TensorFlow Hub – Used to load the pre-trained Neural Style Transfer model

# Pre-trained NST Model – magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256

# Matplotlib – Used for visualizing content, style, and output images

# Google Colab – Cloud-based environment used to develop, run, and test the code
